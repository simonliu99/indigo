<p>Hello! I am a postbaccalaureate fellow at the National Human Genome Research
Institute in the Medical Genomics Unit under Dr. Benjamin Solomon. I am
interested in machine learning and deep learning algorithms that improve patient
outcomes. My recent work involves applying natural language processing to public
and private datasets to build models for extracting patient and language
annotators.</p>

<p>I received a B.S. in Biomedical Engineering from the Johns Hopkins University
in 2021 and completed major requirements for Computer Science. I was also
nominated along with several other members of Health 3D for the Linda Trinh
Memorial Award for our work in manufacturing face shields and other PPE for the
Johns Hopkins Hospital System during the summer of 2020.</p>

<p>I have published several articles and also received the JHU AY 2021 Provost's
Undergraduate Research Award. For a complete list of my publications, please
refer to my <a href="https://simonliu.dev/markdown-cv">CV</a> or
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fwh_UDMAAAAJ&hl=en">Google
Scholar</a>.</p>

<p>In my spare time, I enjoy tinkering with servers and electronics in my homelab,
managing a small server stack I use to host numerous services and game servers.
Notable services include PiHole DNS, Bitwarden, Authelia, and Plex. I also enjoy
weightlifting and hiking among other outdoor activities.</p>
